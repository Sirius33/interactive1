          <li><b>How is art making online different from art making offline ?</b></li>
          <ul>
           	I think the major difference between these two is that art making online involves users. Unlike painting and illustrations, which viewers only need to look at, any online content needs to be made easily accessible to users. This, requires graphic designers to be or cooperate with UI designers. The process of making things online involves more people in different positions, such as graphic designers, UI/UX designers, and programmers; and everything needs to be user-tested before published.

          <li><b>What do you think is the purpose of the web ?</b></li>
          <ul>
            In my opinion, the initial purpose of the web is for people to create and receive information. However, the Internet nowadays is an incredibly efficient yet dangerous tool to do that with. People can live on the internet: we create accounts for a lot of things, which are essentially our digital identities, but those identities can be stolen too, like how Facebook and Cambridge Analytics did. So overall I would say that the internet is like a knife - you can use it to cut food and feed yourself, or you may accidentally get cut by either yourself or someone else. The existence of the internet is neutral, but it just depends on who is using it and how it is being used.
